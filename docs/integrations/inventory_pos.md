### Inventory and POS systems

Reads CSV exports from any point-of-sale system out of a folder: item lists, stock counts, customer lists and sales lines. Nothing is sent to or read from the POS itself, so there is nothing to write back and no webhooks.

| Setting | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `POS_IMPORT_DIR` | The folder the exports are dropped into, outside any git repo |
| `POS_MAPPING_PROFILE` | Optional. `generic`, or the path to a mapping profile JSON in the client's private instance repo |

**Mapping profiles.** A profile names the file patterns for each kind of export, the column for each value, the delimiter, the date order (`mdy`, `dmy` or `ymd`), the store's UTC offset for times written without one, and the system's own payment and category labels. `parsePosProfile` validates one and says which field is wrong. Each column can list several header names; headers match without regard to case or spacing. A profile's `id` is part of every idempotency key, so it must not change once data is imported. Profiles for one client's system belong in that client's instance repo, never here.

The generic profile reads these files and columns. Columns marked * are required; a file missing one stops the sync with the file and the columns named.

| File name contains | Columns |
| --- | --- |
| `item` or `inventory` | SKU*, Title*, Cost*, Retail Price*, Category, Metal, Karat, Weight (g), Quantity, Vendor, On Memo, Received |
| `stock` or `on hand` | SKU*, On Hand*, Date |
| `customer` or `client` | Customer ID*, Name*, Marketing Opt In, Updated |
| `sale`, `transaction` or `receipt` | Sale ID*, Date*, SKU*, Quantity*, Unit Price*, Discount, Sale Total, Payment Method, Customer ID, Salesperson, Channel, Original Sale ID, Return ID |

Only `.csv` and `.txt` files are read. Items are read first, then stock, customers and sales, each in name order.

**What it reads.** Each sync reads the files that are new or changed since the last one. The checkpoint holds each finished file's SHA-256 and, for a file in progress, how many of its events are stored, so a crash resumes mid-file. A changed file is read again from the top, and its unchanged rows come back as duplicates. Files that leave the folder are dropped from the checkpoint. The historical import and incremental syncs work the same way. Rows dated more than five years back are skipped.

**Events.**

| Event | From | Key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `inventory.received` | Each item row with stock. A row with quantity 0 (a piece already sold) is skipped | profile and SKU, so each piece is received once |
| `inventory.counted` | Each stock row: what was on hand on that date | profile, SKU and date |
| `customer.profile_updated` | Name and marketing consent. Consent is never assumed: an empty column is no | profile, customer and a hash of name and consent, so only a real change is a new event |
| `sale.completed` | Sale lines grouped by Sale ID. The export's Sale Total wins over the lines' sum, since it can include tax | profile and sale |
| `sale.returned` | Lines with a negative quantity, grouped by Return ID, or by Sale ID when there is none. A receipt with both (an exchange) gives a sale and a return | profile and return |

Money reads `$1,250.00`, `1250.5` and `(25.00)` without floating point. Metal and karat come from the Metal column (`14K Yellow Gold` is gold, 14k); an unknown metal is kept as `posMetal`. Categories and payment labels map to the departments' values by keyword, after the profile's own labels. Exports list a tender per line, so a sale whose lines name different tenders gets one `other` payment. Rows without a date use the file's modified time, except sales, which need one.

A value that can't be read is left null, so the department schema dead-letters the row with the raw event kept, and every event carries `sourceRow` (`file.csv:12`) to find it. Only mapped columns are read: email addresses, phone numbers and street addresses in an export are never stored.

**Testing.** The tests use synthetic exports only. The CSV reader in `packages/connectors/src/files` (RFC 4180 quoting, CRLF, byte-order marks) and its money, date and flag parsers are shared with the bank statement connector.
