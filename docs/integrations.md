# Integrations

The catalog lives in code at [`packages/core/src/integrations.ts`](../packages/core/src/integrations.ts). The first entries come from the original Brain A Integration Mapping sheet; the rest cover the wider stack that jewelry retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers run. Tests check two things: every setting an integration needs is documented in [`secrets/manifest.json`](../secrets/manifest.json), and every integration appears in the tables below.

`integrationsFor("retail" | "wholesale" | "manufacturing")` returns the systems a given kind of business is likely to run, which is where onboarding starts.

## Build order: self-serve first

The first phase builds every integration we can finish without asking any vendor, company or person for anything: a public API with a free developer sandbox, or a file or EDI format we can test with synthetic samples. `selfServeIntegrations()` returns that list (37 systems today). Systems that need a paid subscription, a trade account or a partnership come later, once the core is built out.

Which vendors offer a free sandbox is our current understanding as of October 2026. Confirm it when signing up for each developer account.

## How each system can be reached

| Access | Meaning | What a connector does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public API | Documented API the business can authorize on its own | Historical import, incremental sync and webhooks where offered |
| Partner | An API exists but needs a vendor partnership or approval | Start from scheduled exports while the partnership is set up |
| EDI | X12 or XML documents through a VAN, AS2 or SFTP | Parse purchase orders, ship notices, invoices, inventory (846) and sell-through (852) |
| File export | Exports or statements are the only route today | Import CSV or PDF on a schedule through the same pipeline |
| Unknown | No access route confirmed yet | Ask the vendor; fall back to exports |

Most jewelry-specific POS systems (The Edge, Jewel360, ARMS) publish no public API, so exports come first for them. Diamond networks (RapNet, IDEX, Nivoda) list many of the same stones, so connectors match stones on the grading lab and report number before counting inventory.

## Catalog

Used by: R is retail, W is wholesale, M is manufacturing. Test with says how we test the connector without a client's real account. Access details for vendors marked Partner or Unknown still need confirming with the vendor before a connector is built.

## Systems by department

Every department reads from more than one system, and a test keeps it that way. This is also where to look when adding a department: if it has fewer than two systems, the catalog is missing something.

## Bank and card statements

Clients send statements whichever way suits them: CSV exports, PDF statements, or both (for example CSV for recent activity and PDFs for older years). `CHASE_IMPORT_MODE` takes `manual_csv`, `manual_pdf` or `manual_csv_and_pdf`, and other banks follow the same pattern. Both formats go through the same pipeline, and the statement connector must match transactions by account, date, amount and description so one that appears in both a CSV and a PDF is stored once.

Statements are customer data. They never go in a git repo, including private ones.

## Testing the integrations

Every system we connect to changes over time, so each connector is tested at four levels as it is built. The unit and contract levels use the connector test kit below; the live and docs levels are still to come:

| Level | What it checks | When it runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | Normalizers turn recorded and synthetic payloads into valid events | Every push |
| Contract | Recorded responses from each vendor still match what the connector expects (fields, types, pagination, webhook signatures) | Every push |
| Live sandbox | Each connector runs a historical import and an incremental sync against the vendor's own sandbox, and a test webhook is delivered | Nightly |
| Docs watch | Each vendor's API changelog and version list is checked for changes, deprecations and new versions | Daily |

A failure at the live or docs level opens an issue naming the integration, what changed and the evidence. Sandbox credentials are test-only and live in the CI secret store, never in the repo. Synthetic fixtures contain no real customer data.

### The connector test kit

`@karatos/connector-testkit` (in `packages/testkit`) is what every connector's tests use. A sample connector in `packages/testkit/test` uses every helper.

| Helper | What it gives a connector test |
| --- | --- |
| `fixtureBuilder`, `synthetic` | Numbered synthetic records with reserved test emails (`.test`), fictional 555-01xx phone numbers, test SKUs and fixed timestamps |
| `assertSynthetic` | Fails if a fixture holds a real-looking email, phone number or card number, and names where |
| `replayFetch`, `loadRecordings` | A `fetch` that answers from recorded vendor responses, in order, so contract tests run without the network. `unused()` catches requests the connector stopped making |
| `scrubRecording`, `assertScrubbed` | Recordings never hold request headers; tokens in URLs and cookie or auth headers in responses are redacted, and a recording that still holds one won't load |
| `checkConnectorSync` | Runs the connector through a full import, a replay (everything must count as a duplicate), a crash after the first batch plus resume from the checkpoint, and a retried source outage. Every broken scenario is listed in one error |
| `hmacSha256`, `timestampedSignature`, `tamper` | Signed webhook deliveries, and tampered ones, to test signature checks |
| `assertWritesRefused` | Runs every write the connector declares through a read-only `WriteGate` and checks each is refused and audited |

## The connector contract

Every connector implements `Connector` from `@karatos/core`:

- `historicalImport(context)` and `incrementalSync(context)` yield batches of raw records, each with a cursor.
- `handleWebhook(body)`, where the source supports webhooks, turns one delivery into raw records. Verify the signature first.

`runSync` does the rest, so every connector gets the same guarantees:

- The checkpoint advances only after a whole batch is stored, so a crash resumes from the last good batch.
- Source errors are retried with backoff by restarting from the checkpoint. Brain A's own errors are not retried.
- Invalid records are dead-lettered and counted, and never stop the sync.
- Replays are counted as duplicates and stored once.
- Every record is stamped with the instance's organization and the connector's source.

## Writing back: built, turned off

Every connector starts read-only. A connector may declare the write actions it could perform (`writes` on `Connector`), such as adjusting Shopify stock or creating a QuickBooks invoice, but each one runs through a `WriteGate`:

- The gate refuses any action the instance has not listed in `ENABLED_WRITES`, which is empty by default. Entries are `integration:action`, or `integration:*` for every action of one integration.
- Every attempt is audited, whether it was refused, performed or failed, with who asked for it.
- Connectors request only read scopes from vendors until a client agrees to writes.

So write support can be built and tested now, and switched on per client and per action later.
